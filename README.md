## ToDo

- Mess around with different fonts
- Decide on a dark mode theme and implement it
- Update all styles to be mobile first then apply larger styles at bigger breakpoints as per tailwind docs. Make sure to read tailwind docs on responsive design first as this site is desktop first.
- Consider overall site theme perhaps in relation to eventual landing section colors
- SEO Optimisation https://nystudio107.com/blog/modern-seo-snake-oil-vs-substance
- Think about tooltip implementation and perhaps use or base
  custom solution off https://floating-ui.com/
- Consider animating theme toggle to be link link where it slides into the text then out of it
- Consider alternative primary color (not blue based)
- Add some more granular unit tests for components
- Look into react internal mechanics more. Where to put functions and constants, maybe
  look at some other projects
- Add tests for about me email tooltip
- Add MDN tooltip reccomendations for accessability
- Potentially refactor tooltip code, i.e. generic width and height values
- Re-usability for generic tooltip component
- Refactor all tests and look at react unit tests for unit test inspiration
- Deplay and do real world testing on both desktop and mobile devices
- Deploy and check lighthouse score and implement possible optimisations
- Write a beautiful readme with badges for github workflows and maybe code analysis
- Follow next documentation for how to load test env in jest (https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables) and playwright
