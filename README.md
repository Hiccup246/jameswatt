## ToDo

- Decide on a dark mode theme and implement it
- Update all styles to be mobile first then apply larger styles at bigger breakpoints as per tailwind docs. Make sure to read tailwind docs on responsive design first as this site is desktop first.
- Consider overall site theme perhaps in relation to eventual landing section colors
- SEO Optimisation https://nystudio107.com/blog/modern-seo-snake-oil-vs-substance
- Consider animating theme toggle to be link link where it slides into the text then out of it
- Consider alternative primary color (not blue based)
- Potentially refactor tooltip code, i.e. generic width and height values
- Re-usability for generic tooltip component
- Refactor all tests and look at react unit tests for unit test inspiration
- Deplay and do real world testing on both desktop and mobile devices
- Deploy and check lighthouse score and implement possible optimisations
- Write a beautiful readme with badges for github workflows and maybe code analysis
