## ToDo

- Mess around with different fonts
- Ensure website works fine on mobile
- Decide on a dark mode theme and implement it
- Update all styles to be mobile first then apply larger styles at bigger breakpoints as per tailwind docs. Make sure to read tailwind docs on responsive design first as this site is desktop first.
- Consider overall site theme perhaps in relation to eventual landing section colors
- SEO Optimisation https://nystudio107.com/blog/modern-seo-snake-oil-vs-substance
- Think about tooltip implementation and perhaps use or base
  custom solution off https://floating-ui.com/
- Consider animating theme toggle to be link link where it slides into the text then out of it
- Consider alternative primary color (not blue based)
- Add playwright e2e tests
- Add some more granular unit tests for components
- Look into react internal mechanics more. Where to put functions and constants, maybe
look at some other projects
