## üß† Understanding the project

A great starting place for understanding this project is the `pages/index.page.tsx` file. This represents the single page of this single page application (SPA) and allows for easy exploration of all the sites components.

This file contains some site metadata and lists out all of the sites 'sections'. These sections are located within `components/sections` and compose components from `components/` to create the functionality of the site. In visual terms the `index.page.tsx` can be represented by:

## ‚õ∞Ô∏è Environment Variables

This project has three environment variables

1. UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID
2. UMAMI_WEBSITE_URL
3. NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_CONTACT_EMAIL

The first two are related to the projects analytics service [umami](https://umami.is/). These can be removed along with the umami tracking tag in `pages/_document.page.tsx` if you do not plan to utilise the tracking service.

The final environment variable is used to store the email address which is linked to in the `AboutMeSection.tsx`.

## üçΩÔ∏è Fair use and forking

_*Plagarism*_ is **not good**

_*Claiming*_ others work as your own is **not good**

Fair usage of others work with proper attribution is **awesome!**

So feel free to fork this repository or utilise any code snippets but please make an effort to give me proper credit by linking back to [jameswatt.io](https://www.jameswatt.io). If you need some ideas on how to do so this check out the credits section of this website :)

Cheers!
